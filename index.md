### What do you find here?

As promised, you can find all the important information here so that you can use Microsoft's cloud services for the challenges in the upcoming days as well as for your further studies and work. This is not an official website provided by Microsoft. It is just a personal summary of me for you, the hackaTUM 2021 participants.

### How to get started

For the first steps with Azure I recommend to visit the official **"Get started"** guide you can find [HERE](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started). There is a special offer for students who would like to try Azure where you can use $100 in 12 months and also have access to tools such as Visual Studio Code -> [Try Azure for Students free today](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/). Additionally, you will receive Azure credits for the challenges from Microsoft for the event.

The [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) is a graphical way of deploying and managing Azure resources. Where you can e.g., use the **Quickstart Center** to rapidly deploy your first cloud services.

## Useful Microsoft Azure Services

This list is definitely not complete, but should give you an overview about some Azure services, you could use during the upcoming days.

## Skill yourself

Microsoft offers a variety of learning paths and certificates. There are multiple fundamental certificates which you can complete free of charge. Visit Microsoft docs and check out the [Microsoft Virtual Training Days](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/techwiese/events/microsoft-training-days.aspx). 


## You would like to work in tech?

During my studies, I also worked two years as a working student for Microsoft, and I can just say, it's a enjoyable and interesting working environment, so if you would like to work in tech - just give it a try and apply, there are always open positions for students as well as early in career opportunities.
